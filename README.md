[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) workflows I whipped up.

Enable/disable grayscale mode in Accessibility; using code from <https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/342551>.

Keyword: `grayscale`, `greyscale`

`print-selected.alfredworkflow`

Adds a File Action <https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/file-action/> which runs an Automator workflow <https://support.apple.com/guide/automator/welcome/mac> to send selected Finder items to your default printer.

File action: `Print selected files`, `Send files to printer`
